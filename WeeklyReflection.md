# Weekly Reflection

## Week 2
1/28/2016 - 5 hours

Tasks Completed:

- Chose a project goal
- Reviewed SkinnySki.com
- Created this repository
- Wrote the problem statement
- Started documenting the project plan
- Completed user stories
- Drew screen design

Last week, I only had a broad concept for my app, but today, the project's direction became much clearer through the process of writing the Problem Statement and defining the User Stories. 
In particular, working on the Screen Design allowed me to visually map out how the interface color will change according to the weather when a user searches for a city. 
This visual exercise helped me realize the core value of the app: capturing the "atmosphere" of a trip beyond just text.

By organizing the User Stories and identifying the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) features, 
I realized that I need to prioritize the core logic of 'Weather API Integration' and 'Dynamic Background Color Adjustment' over the more vague ideas I initially had. 
Once the screen layouts are fully finalized next week, I expect to create a more detailed technical plan for how the backend will process and store this environmental data.
